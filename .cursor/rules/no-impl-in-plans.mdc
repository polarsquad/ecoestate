# No Implementation Code in Planning Files

**Type:** Strict Prohibition

## Rule Description
Do not add actual implementation code (like completed Dockerfiles, .devcontainer configurations, or application code) to
planning files. Planning files (located in the `plans/` or `memory-bank/` directories) should only contain high-level descriptions,
specifications, and task lists - never the actual code implementation.

## Rationale
Planning documents should maintain a clear separation from implementation. This separation ensures that:
1. Planning files remain concise and focused on requirements and design decisions
2. Implementation details are properly placed in the codebase
3. Plans can be reviewed independently of implementation details
4. Planning files don't become bloated with code that belongs elsewhere

## Allowed Behavior
- Adding task descriptions and specifications to planning files
- Including small code snippets *as examples* when necessary for clarification
- Referencing implementation approaches at a high level
- Adding checklists and requirements

## Example Violations
- Adding complete Dockerfiles or Docker Compose configurations to `plans/implementation-plan.md`
- Inserting fully-implemented JavaScript/TypeScript functions into planning documents
- Copying actual configuration files (like .devcontainer.json) into planning files

## Example Allowed Actions
- Describing Docker container requirements in planning files
- Outlining what a Dockerfile should include at a high level
- Mentioning required environment variables or configuration parameters
- Listing the steps needed to implement a feature

Remember: Implementation goes in implementation files, planning goes in planning files.
