  - [x] Snapshot of prices for a specific year shown per postcode and visualized with a
        heatmap
  - [x] Ability to select the year for which prices are shown
  - [x] Ability to select between multiple togglable visualizations
        (the heatmap is the first one)
  - [x] Different togglable visualization for price trend
        (toggle between this and the heatmap)
- [x] Render environmental data on interactive map layers
- [x] Implement UI components to toggle visibility of layers (green-space)

### Deliverables
- [x] Interactive, fully functional map interface
- [x] Layer toggling and user-friendly UI interactions

## üîÑ Phase 4: Deployment and Testing

### Completed Tasks

#### ‚úÖ Containerization
- [x] Frontend Container Setup
  - [x] Created multi-stage Dockerfile for frontend
  - [x] Added .dockerignore file for frontend
  - [x] Tested frontend container build and run locally

- [x] Backend Container Setup
  - [x] Created multi-stage Dockerfile for backend
  - [x] Added .dockerignore file for backend
  - [x] Tested backend container build and run locally

- [x] Docker Compose for Local Development
  - [x] Created docker-compose.yml in project root
  - [x] Implemented named volumes for node_modules
  - [x] Configured environment variables for service communication
  - [x] Tested and verified Docker Compose setup

#### ‚úÖ Infrastructure as Code Setup
- [x] Create Terraform configuration for Azure infrastructure
  - [x] Define Azure Container Registry resource
  - [x] Configure Azure Container Apps environment
  - [x] Setup networking resources (VNet, subnets if needed)
  - [x] Create variables for environment-specific configurations

#### ‚úÖ Deployment Tooling
- [x] Create script for building, tagging, and pushing Docker images to ACR (`scripts/acr_upload.sh`)

### üîÑ Next Steps to Complete

#### Setup short URL for frontend app
- [x] Configure custom domain for the frontend Azure Container App to use a short URL with Azure-managed certificate and Azure DNS.
  - [x] Modify `container_apps` module to use `azurerm_container_app_custom_domain` resource.
  - [x] Update module variables to accept `frontend_custom_hostname`, `dns_zone_name`, and `dns_zone_resource_group_name`.
  - [x] Implement `azurerm_dns_txt_record` in the module for automatic domain validation.
  - [x] Implement `azurerm_dns_cname_record` in the module to point the custom hostname to the app (for subdomains).
  - [x] Terraform now fully automates this process if `frontend_custom_hostname` and Azure DNS details are provided.

#### Separate application release from Terraform infrastructure code
- [x] Release app without running `terraform apply`
  - [x] Modify `container_apps` module to ignore image tag changes to frontend & backend
  - [x] Create alternate way to change the image tag in Azure Container apps without TF

#### Static analysis of Terraform code using tfsec
- [x] Set up TFsec for static analysis of Terraform code in the tf/ dir
  - [x] Document the setup in tf/README.md
  - [x] Fix findings from TFsec

#### CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] Setup automated build and deployment
  - [ ] Create GitHub Actions pipeline
  - [ ] Configure build, test, and deployment stages
  - [ ] Set up automated testing before deployment

##### Detailed CI/CD Pipeline Plan (GitHub Actions)

1. **Initial Pipeline: Static Analysis Only**
   - [x] Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for CI pipeline
   - [x] Add job to run ESLint on all TypeScript code (frontend and backend)
   - [x] Add job to run TFsec on all Terraform code in `tf/`
   - [x] Ensure pipeline fails if either linter or TFsec finds errors

2. **Add Test Execution**
   - [ ] Extend pipeline to run backend tests (Jest/Supertest)
   - [ ] Extend pipeline to run frontend tests (Jest/React Testing Library)
   - [ ] Ensure test jobs run after static analysis and fail the pipeline on test failure

3. **Next Steps (not implemented in this task)**
   - [ ] Add build and Docker image push steps
   - [ ] Add deployment automation (using scripts/acr_upload.sh, scripts/deploy_app.sh)
   - [ ] Integrate secrets management (Azure Key Vault)
   - [ ] Add environment matrix for dev/staging/prod

#### Deployment and Verification
- [ ] Deploy backend and frontend to Azure Container Apps
  - [ ] Push container images to registry
  - [ ] Deploy containers using Terraform
  - [ ] Configure load balancing and scaling rules
- [ ] Test deployment thoroughly
  - [ ] Verify API responsiveness in production environment
  - [ ] Test frontend interactivity in production
  - [ ] Conduct performance tests (loading speed, API latency)
  - [ ] Test on multiple browsers and devices

#### Secrets and Environment Management
- [ ] Configure environment variables securely
  - [ ] Setup Azure Key Vault for secrets management
  - [ ] Configure environment variable injection into containers
  - [ ] Ensure proper separation of dev/staging/prod environments

### Deliverables
- [x] Containerized applications (frontend and backend)
- [x] Docker Compose configuration for local development
- [x] Infrastructure as Code templates for reproducible environments
- [x] Publicly accessible, functional MVP web application
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments

## ‚¨ú Phase 5: Refinement & Documentation

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement initial correlation logic (basic aggregation by postal code/municipality)
- [ ] Develop detailed pop-ups providing correlation insights at selected locations
- [ ] Write user-friendly documentation and usage guidelines
- [ ] Document code clearly (frontend/backend)
- [ ] Collect initial user feedback and address critical issues
- [ ] Plan future improvements based on user feedback and usage analytics

### Deliverables
- Comprehensive README and user documentation
- Code repository with clear instructions

---

## Testing rules

- Both frontend and backend code needs tests
- Test-driven development should be used
  - If an implementation already exists, it is OK for tests written against it to succeed
- When making changes, be sure to always run tests to verify their correctness

---

## üîÆ Future Expansion Opportunities (Beyond MVP)

- Advanced correlation analysis (regression, ML predictions)
- User-generated content (reviews, environmental feedback)
- Real-time data updates and push notifications
- International expansion beyond Finland
