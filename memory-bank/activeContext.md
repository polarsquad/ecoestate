# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

Based on the implementation plan, the project is currently in the following state:

- **Phase 1 (Initial Setup & Data Exploration)**: âœ… COMPLETE
  - Git repository and basic folder structure established
  - React frontend initialized
  - Backend API (Node.js + Express + TypeScript) set up
  - API keys registered and obtained
  - API data availability and quality verified

- **Phase 2 (Data Integration and Backend Development)**: âœ… COMPLETE
  - Backend endpoints created for property prices, green-space data, and postcode boundaries
  - Automated scheduled tasks implemented for data updates

- **Phase 3 (Frontend Development & Map Visualization)**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
  - React mapping library integrated (Leaflet or Mapbox GL JS)
  - Environmental data layers implemented
  - UI components for layer toggling implemented
  - Property price data visualization partially implemented:
    - âœ… Year-specific price heatmap visualization
    - âœ… Year selection functionality
    - âœ… Toggle between different visualizations
    - âœ… Price trend visualization
    - â¬œ Some final adjustments may be needed

- **Phase 4 (Deployment and Testing)**: â¬œ NOT STARTED
  - Dockerfiles for frontend & backend needed
  - Azure Container Apps deployment pending
  - Environment variable configuration required
  - Thorough testing of deployment pending
  - Performance testing needed

- **Phase 5 (Refinement & Documentation)**: â¬œ NOT STARTED
  - Correlation logic implementation needed
  - Detailed pop-ups for insights to be developed
  - Documentation to be written
  - User feedback to be collected

## Recent Changes

- Frontend map visualization components implemented
- Layer toggling functionality added
- Year selection for property prices implemented
- Multiple visualization types created (heatmap and trend visualization)

## Next Steps

1. Begin containerization with Docker
2. Implement deployment pipeline to Azure
3. Develop correlation analysis features
4. Create comprehensive documentation

## Active Decisions

- **Map Library**: Using Leaflet.js for map visualization due to its flexibility
- **Visualization Approach**: Implemented heatmap for prices and toggleable layers for environmental data

## Current Challenges

- Ensuring efficient rendering of map with multiple data layers
- Optimizing backend responses for large datasets
- Planning for the implementation of correlation analysis

## User Feedback Insights

- Not yet collected - will be gathered after initial deployment

## Implementation Learnings

- Geospatial data visualization requires careful optimization
- Property price data from Statistics Finland requires preprocessing for effective visualization
- Environmental data layers should be togglable to prevent visual overload
