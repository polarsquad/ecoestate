# Project Progress

## ‚úÖ What Works

### Backend
- Basic API infrastructure with Node.js and Express
- Property price data endpoints from Statistics Finland API
- Environmental data endpoints (green spaces, public transport)
- Postcode area boundary data integration
- Scheduled tasks for data updates and caching

### Frontend
- React application structure with TypeScript
- Map visualization integration (Leaflet or Mapbox GL JS)
- Property price heatmap visualization
- Year selection for viewing historical price data
- Toggle functionality for different visualization types
- Environmental data layer rendering
- Layer visibility toggling UI components

## üîÑ In Progress

- Finalizing property price visualization features
- Refining user interface for optimal usability
- Optimizing map performance with multiple data layers

## ‚¨ú What's Left to Build

### Deployment Infrastructure
- Docker containerization for frontend and backend
- Azure Container Apps deployment setup
- Terraform infrastructure as code
- Environment variable configuration for production

### Analysis Features
- Correlation logic between property prices and environmental factors
- Detailed location-specific insights and pop-ups
- Statistical analysis visualizations

### Documentation & Testing
- User documentation and guidelines
- Code documentation
- Comprehensive testing (API, frontend, performance)

## üìä Current Status

The project is progressing well through Phase 3 of the implementation plan. The core map visualization and data integration features are implemented, with upcoming focus on containerization and deployment.

### Completed Phases
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Initial Project Setup & Data Exploration
- ‚úÖ Phase 2: Data Integration and Backend Development
- üîÑ Phase 3: Frontend Development & Interactive Map Visualization (nearly complete)

### Upcoming Phases
- ‚¨ú Phase 4: Deployment and Testing
- ‚¨ú Phase 5: Refinement & Documentation

## üîç Known Issues

- Need to optimize data loading for larger geographical areas
- Environmental data visualization may need performance improvements
- Correlation analysis implementation strategy still being finalized

## üìù Evolution of Project Decisions

- Initially considered simpler visualization library but opted for more powerful Leaflet/Mapbox for better control
- Decided on toggleable layers approach for better user experience versus showing all data simultaneously
- Chose to implement both snapshot and trend visualizations for more comprehensive insights
