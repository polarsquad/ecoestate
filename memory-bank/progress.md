# Project Progress

## ‚úÖ What Works

### Backend
- Basic API infrastructure with Node.js and Express
- Property price data endpoints from Statistics Finland API
- Environmental data endpoints (green spaces, public transport)
- Postcode area boundary data integration
- Scheduled tasks for data updates and caching

### Frontend
- React application structure with TypeScript
- Map visualization integration (Leaflet.js)
- Property price heatmap visualization
- Year selection for viewing historical price data
- Toggle functionality for different visualization types
- Environmental data layer rendering
- Layer visibility toggling UI components

### Development Environment
- **‚úÖ Complete Docker Compose setup for local development:**
  - Multi-service orchestration for frontend, backend (and optionally database)
  - Named volumes for dependency management
  - Environment variable configuration
  - Cross-container networking and communication
  - Hot reloading and development-optimized containers

## üîÑ In Progress

- Azure Deployment Infrastructure Planning (Terraform, ACA, ACR)
- CI/CD Pipeline Planning

## ‚¨ú What's Left to Build

### Azure Deployment Infrastructure
- Azure Container Registry configuration
- Azure Container Apps environment setup
- Network configuration and security settings
- Load balancing and scaling rules
  
- **Infrastructure as Code:**
  - Terraform configuration files
  - Variables for environment-specific settings
  
- **CI/CD Pipeline:**
  - GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps pipeline
  - Build, test, and deployment stages
  - Automated testing before deployment
  
- **Secrets Management:**
  - Azure Key Vault integration
  - Secure environment variable handling
  - Environment separation (dev/staging/prod)

### Analysis Features
- Correlation logic between property prices and environmental factors
- Detailed location-specific insights and pop-ups
- Statistical analysis visualizations

### Documentation & Testing
- User documentation and guidelines
- Code documentation
- Comprehensive testing (API, frontend, performance)

## üìä Current Status

The project has successfully completed Phase 3 of the implementation plan with all frontend visualization features implemented. Phase 4 is now in progress with containerization fully implemented for local development using Docker Compose. The next steps involve Azure infrastructure setup and CI/CD pipeline creation.

### Completed Phases
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Initial Project Setup & Data Exploration
- ‚úÖ Phase 2: Data Integration and Backend Development
- ‚úÖ Phase 3: Frontend Development & Interactive Map Visualization

### Current Phase
- üîÑ Phase 4: Deployment and Testing
  - ‚úÖ Containerization with Docker fully implemented
  - ‚úÖ Docker Compose setup implemented and functional for multi-service development
  - üîÑ Planning Azure infrastructure setup with Terraform
  - üîÑ Planning CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps

### Upcoming Phases
- ‚¨ú Phase 5: Refinement & Documentation

## üîç Known Issues

- Need to ensure secure handling of API keys and secrets in production environment
- Container optimization for efficient deployment
- Planning for proper scaling in Azure environment
- Development of effective testing strategy for deployed application

## üìù Evolution of Project Decisions

- Initially considered simpler visualization library but opted for more powerful Leaflet.js for better control
- Decided on toggleable layers approach for better user experience versus showing all data simultaneously
- Chose to implement both snapshot and trend visualizations for more comprehensive insights
- Selected Docker and Azure Container Apps for deployment to ensure scalability and maintainability
- Decided to use Terraform for infrastructure management to ensure reproducible environments
- Enhanced development workflow with containerized local development
- Implemented multi-stage Docker builds for optimized production images
- **Implemented Docker Compose for local multi-service development workflow**
- **Refined containerization approach with named volumes to preserve node_modules and prevent conflicts**
- **Configured dynamic environment variables for different runtime contexts (local vs. containerized)**
